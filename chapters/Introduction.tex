Background, motivation and overview of thesis.
Blast loads can be unintentional (accidental explosion, Beirut explosion), or intentional (terrorism, IED, Oslo 2011). Want to design structures that are resilient to blast loads. Structures has the potential to protect people from blast loads, but structural collapse can cause harm. Example: Pakistan Mosque suicide bombing.
Fluid-structure interaction. Numerical simulation. Machine learning to represent fsi effects.
